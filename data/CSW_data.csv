20-year mean and standard deviation probability that the seafloor is below the halocline in the Baltic ÔÇô Version 2022,"Based on DHI operational Hydrodynamic 3D Model DKBS2hd model run results, a point dataset describing for each year the probability of a certain seabed location in the Baltic Sea being located below the deep halocline was created. The spatial coverage was the Baltic Sea. The spatial resolution was 5km. The temporal coverage was 20 years (2001-2020). The 2 rasters made available here result from interpolation of the point dataset, and represent 20-year probability (respectively average and standard deviation) values.
The development of the original point dataset was funded by the EMODnet lot ÔÇÿSeabed HabitatsÔÇÖ for use in the development of the EUSeaMap product, more specifically in modeling the spatial distribution of the biological zones ÔÇÿcircalittoralÔÇÖ and ÔÇÿoffshore circalittoralÔÇÖ. According to the EUNIS habitat classification, in the Baltic Sea the circalittoral is above the halocline/pycnocline, while the offshore circalittoral is below.","https://gis.ices.dk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/9e4edb30-aefb-4551-9c6f-7cf324b4edb3;

Baltic Sea - Beach litter aggregated datasets 2011/2023 v2024,"EMODnet Chemistry aims to provide access to marine chemistry data sets and derived data products concerning eutrophication, ocean acidification, contaminants and litter. The chosen parameters are relevant for  the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), in particular for descriptors 5, 8, 9 and 10. The dataset contains standardized, harmonized and validated data collections from beach litter (monitoring and other sources). 
Datasets concerning beach and seafloor litter data are loaded in a central database after a semi-automated validation phase. Once loaded, a data assessment is performed in order to check data consistency and potential errors are corrected thanks to a feedback loop with data originators.
For beach litter, the harmonized datasets contain all unrestricted EMODnet Chemistry data on beach litter, including monitoring data, data from cleaning surveys and data from research. A relevant part of the monitoring data has been considered for assessment purposes by the European institutions and therefore is tagged as MSFD_monitoring. EMODnet beach litter data and databases are hosted and maintained by 'Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale, Division of Oceanography (OGS/NODC)' from Italy.
Data are formatted following Guidelines and forms for gathering marine litter data, which can be found at: https://doi.org/10.6092/15c0d34c-a01a-4091-91ac-7c4f561ab508
The updated vocabularies of admitted values are available at:
https://nodc.ogs.it/marinelitter/vocab
The harmonized datasets can be downloaded as EMODnet Beach litter data format  Version 7.0, which is a spreadsheet file composed of 4 sheets: beach metadata, survey metadata, animals and litter. Local_CDI field in the survey metadata sheet allows to retrieve the original data.","https://nodc.ogs.it/repository/aggregated-datasets/litter/EMODnet_beachLitter_Baltic_2024_unrestricted.zip;

Baltic Sea - Contaminants aggregated datasets 1972/2017 v2018,"EMODnet Chemistry aims to provide access to marine chemistry data sets and derived data products concerning eutrophication, ocean acidification and contaminants. The chemicals chosen reflect importance to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This regional aggregated dataset contains all unrestricted EMODnet Chemistry data on contaminants (49 parameters), and covers the Baltic Sea with 3818 CDI records divided per matrices: 1358 biota (396 Vertical profiles and 962 Time series),906 water profiles, 2510 sediment profiles. Vertical profiles temporal range is from 1985-04-16 to 2016-09-27. Time series temporal range is from 1972-05-02 to 2017-10-30. Data were aggregated and quality controlled by ‘Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)’ from Sweden.	
Regional datasets concerning contaminants are automatically harvested. Parameter names in these datasets are based on P01, BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary, which is available at: http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/bandit/browse_step.php . Each measurement value has a quality flag indicator. The resulting data collections for each Sea Basin are harmonised, and the collections are quality controlled by EMODnet Chemistry Regional Leaders using ODV Software and following a common methodology for all Sea Regions. 
Harmonisation means that: (1) unit conversion is carried out to express contaminant concentrations with a limited set of measurement units (according to EU directives 2013/39/UE; Comm. Dec. EU 2017/848) and (2) merging of variables described by different “local names” ,but corresponding exactly to the same concepts in BODC P01 vocabulary.
The harmonised dataset can be downloaded as ODV spreadsheet (TXT file), which is composed of metadata header followed by tab separated values. This worksheet can be imported to ODV Software for visualisation (More information can be found at: https://www.seadatanet.org/Software/ODV ).
The same dataset is offered also as XLSX file in a long/vertical format, in which each P01 measurement is a record line. Additionally, there are a series of columns that split P01 terms in subcomponents (measure, substance, CAS number, matrix...).This transposed format is more adapted to worksheet applications users (e.g. LibreOffice Calc).
The 49 parameter names in this metadata record are based on P02, SeaDataNet Parameter Discovery Vocabulary, which is available at: http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_bodc_vocab_v2/vocab_relations.asp?lib=P02 .

The importance of the selected substances and other parameters relates to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This aggregated dataset contains all unrestricted EMODnet Chemistry data on eutrophication and acidity, and covers the Baltic Sea. Data were aggregated and quality controlled by ""Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)"" in Sweden.
ITS-90 water temperature and water body salinity variables have also been included ('as are') to complete the eutrophication and acidity data. If you use these variables for calculations, please refer to SeaDataNet for the quality flags: https://www.seadatanet.org/Products/Aggregated-datasets .
Regional datasets concerning eutrophication and acidity are automatically harvested, and the resulting collections are aggregated and quality controlled using ODV Software and following a common methodology for all sea regions ( https://doi.org/10.13120/8xm0-5m67 ). Parameter names are based on P35 vocabulary, which relates to EMODnet Chemistry aggregated parameter names and is available at: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/P35/ .
When not present in original data, water body nitrate plus nitrite was calculated by summing all nitrate and nitrite parameters. The same procedure was applied for water body dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), which was calculated by summing all nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium parameters. Concentrations per unit mass were converted to a unit volume using a constant density of 1.25 kg/L.
The aggregated dataset can also be downloaded as an ODV collection and spreadsheet, which is composed of a metadata header followed by tab separated values. This spreadsheet can be imported to ODV Software for visualisation (more information can be found at: https://www.seadatanet.org/Software/ODV ).","https://nodc.ogs.it/repository/aggregated-datasets/eutrophication/EMD_Eutrophication_Baltic_2024_unrestricted.zip;

Baltic Sea - Seafloor litter aggregated datasets 2011/2024 v2024,"EMODnet Chemistry aims to provide access to marine chemistry data sets and derived data products concerning eutrophication, ocean acidification, contaminants and litter. The chosen parameters are relevant for  the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), in particular for descriptors 5, 8, 9 and 10. The datasets contain standardized, harmonized and validated data collections from seafloor litter. 
Datasets concerning seafloor litter data are loaded in a central database after a semi-automated validation phase. Once loaded, a data assessment is performed in order to check data consistency and potential errors are corrected thanks to a feedback loop with data originators.
EMODnet seafloor litter data and database are hosted and maintained by ‘Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale, Division of Oceanography (OGS/NODC)’ from Italy.
For seafloor litter, the harmonized datasets contain all unrestricted EMODnet Chemistry data on seafloor litter data.
Data are formatted following Guidelines and forms for gathering marine litter data, which can be found at: https://dx.doi.org/10.6092/15c0d34c-a01a-4091-91ac-7c4f561ab508
The updated vocabularies of admitted values are available at:

The model, produced in Arc Model Builder (10.1), uses datasets 2 to 5 to determine biological zone, which in combination with seabed substrate and energy data can be used to predict the physical habitat at any one location.

In addition, data on salinity at seabed was included in the model, but was not used to determine the final EUNIS habitat class.

The study followed the methodology developped within the EUSeaMap 1 project. For more details about this methodology see documents such as the EUSeaMap 1 final report (Cameron and Askew, 2011), Coltman et al., 2008, or Vasquez et al., 2015
The model was created using raster input layers with a cell size of 0.002dd (roughly 250 meters). The model includes the sublittoral zone only; due to the high variability of the littoral zone, a lack of detailed substrate data and the resolution of the model, it is difficult to predict littoral habitats at this scale.
The map follows the EUNIS 2007-11 classification system, supplemented by additional categories in deep sea areas and in areas lacking full data.

National monitoring of marine litter at beaches was initiated in Denmark in 2015, and on request from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the monitoring activities involving these two beaches in the Baltic Sea are performed by DCE – Danish Centre for Environment and Energy.
The results of the monitoring surveys performed at these two beaches show that plastic comprised the majority of all beach litter items. The amounts of beach litter were in all regions above the EU threshold value of 20 litter items per 100 m beach length. Among some of the most common type of litter items were plastic pieces 2.5-50 cm, polystyrene pieces 2.5-50 cm and String and cord (diameter less than 1cm).",https://cloud.emodnet-ingestion.eu/index.php/s/8uMhX0QcD2gqfWL,"WWW:DOWNLOAD-1.0-http--download;

Phytoplankton alpha diversity in the greater Baltic Sea area,"<p>Biodiversity loss due to human activities is an increasing threat for marine ecosystems and the services we obtain from them. As biodiversity is directly related to the resilience of ecosystems to temporary disturbance, biodiversity monitoring is a vital task for areas subjected to conservation goals. Environmental factors often control the community composition and biodiversity of marine microplankton, such as the pronounced salinity gradient in the Baltic Sea (e.g. Hu et al. 2016). Time series data of biodiversity can therefore provide an indication of changes in community composition due to environmental stressors, such as climate change or eutrophication.</p><p>As many biodiversity estimates are biased by sampling effort, caution must be taken when interpreting alpha diversity from microscopy phytoplankton counts. By rarefaction and evenness estimation, these biases can be reduced, but not ignored.</p>","https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/d761592b5203e428ae8e9b11a63f1515f68f5865;

Potential spawning areas for Baltic flounder (PBS EFH),"Essential fish habitat (EFH) map on Potential spawning areas for Baltic flounder was prepared in PanBalticScope project (co-founded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund of the European Union) http://www.panbalticscope.eu/

Baltic flounder (Platichthys solemdali) is a key species in many coastal areas of the Baltic Sea. It is the only endemic fish species of the Baltic Sea. Baltic flounder spawns in shallow coastal areas and on offshore banks, with eggs developing on the sea floor. Successful spawning may be expected at salinities down to around 5-7 (Nissling et al. 2002). ‘‘Potential spawning areas’ were initially delineated by a species distribution model (Orio et al. 2017) developed based on years 1993-1997 to consider a period with relatively better oxygen conditions, but applied with more recent data (2011-2014). The area was further delineated to encompass only areas shallower than 30 m in order to represent the demersal spawning habitat. ‘High probability spawning areas’ were identified as the sub-section encompassing salinity > 6. It should be noted that flounders in the Baltic Sea were recently separated into two species, and that spawning areas of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) are described separately. The two data layers do not overlap and can be combined to obtain a map on spawning areas for both flounder species taken together. 

Stocks: ICES identifies two stocks of Baltic flounder: ICES subdivisions 26, 28 (East of Gotland and Gulf of Gdansk), and 27, 29-32 (Northern Central Baltic Sea and Northern Baltic Sea).

EFH Type: Spawning areas

Approach: Species distribution modelling combined with identification of environmental salinity window and depth conditions for spawning, supplemented with additional information from monitoring in Estonian waters.

Variables and thresholds: Depth < 30 m, Salinity > 6

Quality: The data layer is based on species distribution modelling focusing on mature flounder at the spawning stage and should be considered a rough estimation. 
The data layers on environmental variables are based on modelling. Other variables than those tested in the model may also be influential.
The studies from which the thresholds values for environmental variables have been obtained are based on publications conducted before the separation of Baltic flounder from European flounder but have taken the specific characteristics of the separate spawning ecotypes into account.

Attribute information: Raster value representing no spawning (0), potential spawning area (0.5) and high probability spawning area (1).
